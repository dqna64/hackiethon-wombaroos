Sleep space is an application designed to help maintain a good sleep schedule within the world of Working From Home. During these times
it is impossible to maintain a sleep schedule and leads to young people staying up later and later. Unfortunately for young people, they
don't understand the mental and physical benefits of maintaining a consistent sleep schedule. This application aims to help by creating
a reward based incentive to stick to a sleep schedule by offering the possibility to travel to new planets and recording your streak.

Due to the lack of a schedule during Working From Home, more and more people slip into the pit of sleeping later and later. The consequences
of this are severe to a person's mental and physical health. Good sleep improves learning, an important factor for people in school that can boost
productivity, good sleep is also associated with decreased chances of obesity, a better wellbeing and is an important aspect for healthy growth and development. 

The target demographic for this website will be students in high school or university who struggle to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.

Sleep Space provides a reward based system to incentivise a consistent sleep schedule for people working from home. The lack of structure while working from home has led to an increasing number of people, especially young people disregarding their sleep schedule leading to sleep deprivation. Good sleep improves learning, an important factor for people in school that can boost
productivity, good sleep is also associated with decreased chances of obesity, a better wellbeing and is an important aspect for healthy growth and development. 

Every day you sleep on time, your rocket goes closer to the next planet, by consistently sleeping on time, the user reaches the next planet. This is used as a reward for their consistency. Once the user reaches the planet, a new planet appears and they travel to that one. If the user decides to sleep after their allocated time, depending on how late they are, fuel and their streak will be lost. A streak and a planet counter both are used to show the user that they are maintaining their good habit.
