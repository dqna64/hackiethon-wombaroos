The lack of structure in our daily routines while working and studying from home has caused many people, especially adolescents, to neglect their sleep schedule. Countless studies have shown that getting sufficient sleep on a regular basis improves concentration, memory retention and cognitive abilities, which are essential for students and workers. We wanted to develop a web app to help us mark the boundary between our work lives and personal wellbeing routines, specifically our sleep hours, so we decided to create Sleep Space.

Sleep Space is a web app which encourages healthy sleeping discipline. To increase motivation, the app has a space-themed graphical interface with a rocket travelling between planets and asteroids to visualise the userâ€™s progress towards maintaining their desired sleep schedule.

Our final product is capable of tracking our sleep schedule with fun space-themed visuals, a punishment system in the form of limited fuel, and a reward system in the form of discovering new planets. By going to bed on time consistently, the user will discover new planets while maintaining a streak which will encourage them to keep a consistent sleep schedule.
